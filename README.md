# Botero-Neural-Network

## Botero or Not Botero? A case study in using neural networks to automate image classification using Python, Tensorflow, and Keras

Fernando Botero is a renowned Colombian painter and sculptor known for his volumetric stylization of figures and objects which is distinct and easily recognizable. 

The goal of this project is to create an image classification machine learning model that is capable of deciding if a given picture is in the style of Fernando Botero or not. This model would not be capable of authenticating a Botero painting, but simply of recognizing the painting style.
